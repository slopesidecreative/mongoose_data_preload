# Seed a Mongo DB using mongoose

An easy way to preload some data into your MongoDB. This is very useful in development. This script can be used as a starter to create loaders for more complex data.

The file should be stored in your server/config directory.
Run the script in the terminal 'node seed.js', then check for your data in the Mongo shell.
